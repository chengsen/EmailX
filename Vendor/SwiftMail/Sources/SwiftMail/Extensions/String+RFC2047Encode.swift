// String+RFC2047Encode.swift
// RFC 2047 "encoded-word" ENCODING for non-ASCII header values (the inverse of
// `decodeMIMEHeader()` in String+QuotedPrintable+MIMEHeader.swift).
//
// RFC 5322 requires header field bodies to be 7-bit ASCII. Any non-ASCII text
// (e.g. a Korean Subject or display name) MUST be wrapped in an RFC 2047
// encoded-word; emitting raw 8-bit bytes in a header invites downstream agents
// to apply their own charset guesses and produce mojibake. (Message *bodies*
// are unaffected because they carry an explicit charset + transfer-encoding;
// header fields have no such mechanism other than RFC 2047.)
